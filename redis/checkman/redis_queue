 This check monitors the length of REDIS Queues.
 Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as
 a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs.

 To get the queue data, you have to install the plugin mk_redis_queue on a REDIS master or slave.

 After setting up the agent, it is possible to set Warning {and/or} Critical levels for the current
 size of each queue.
